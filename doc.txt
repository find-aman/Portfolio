First of all the idea behind Maximojo that to bring all of India's hotels onto OTA Online Travel Agencies is vert great as this will result in generating more revenue for the hotels and everyone wants to see their business growing. So I think this will be very popular in coming time.
Secondly it is a SaaS base company and my major field of study was Cloud Computing so I will be very excited if I got an opportunity how cloud computing works in the real production environment and hence I will try to use my skills to add some value to the organisation.
And the most important its a growing startup which means a huge scope of learning and facing  new challeneges where I can use my knowledge to come up with some nice solutions.


According to me one invention/innovation that is confirmed to be most important in next 10 years is the Blockchain Technology. As it is a very rapidly growing technology. In the upcoming 10 years we will definately be able to see a variety of usage of Blockchian Technology in various industries among which banking will me the major according to me. Other industries like security, validation and verfiaction services, use of distributed systems, distributed cloud computing etc are some of the use cases of the technology.
The are various reason behind the rapid growth of this technology like tamper proof data tranfer over the network, annonimity, most secure till date, most robust system. 
Another aspect of the technology are the cryptocurrencies whose base is blockchian technology. Sooner or later I think every indutry have to accept the benifts of crypto currencies, as they are most secured way of making a financial transasction between two parties.They are very cost effective, fast, and most relible.
